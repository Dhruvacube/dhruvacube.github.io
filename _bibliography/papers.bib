  abstract={Advancements in bionic technology are transforming the possibilities for restoring hand function in individuals with amputations or paralysis. This paper introduces a cost-effective bionic arm design that leverages mind-controlled functionality and integrates a sense of touch to replicate natural hand movements. The system utilizes a non-invasive EEG-based control mechanism, enabling users to operate the arm using brain signals processed into PWM commands for servo motor control of the bionic arm. Additionally, the design incorporates a touch sensor (tactile feedback) in the gripper, offering sensory feedback to enhance user safety and dexterity. The proposed bionic arm prioritizes three essential features: Integrated Sensory Feedback; Mind-Control Potentia; Non-Invasive Nature. This novel approach aims to deliver an intuitive, natural, and efficient solution for restoring complex hand functions.},
