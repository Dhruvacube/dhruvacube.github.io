  title = {Assessing the Feasibility of Creating a WALL-E-Like Robot For Human Assistance},
  doi = {10.13140/RG.2.2.27679.53926},
  abstract = {The concept of creating robots for human assistance has gained significant attention in recent years. This abstract explores the feasibility of developing a robot akin to WALL-E, the beloved fictional character from Pixar's animated film, as an assistant for human tasks and interactions. Drawing inspiration from WALL-E's characteristics, including mobility, communication abilities, and emotional resonance, this study examines the technological, practical, and ethical considerations of bringing such a robot to reality. The feasibility assessment encompasses several dimensions. First, the technological aspect delves into the current state of robotics, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and mobility systems, evaluating their potential to replicate WALL-E's functionality. This involves analyzing advancements in AI cognition, sensor miniaturization, battery efficiency, and mobility mechanisms. Second, practical considerations encompass the robot's physical design, its capacity to navigate real-world environments, and its ability to perform a range of tasks-from basic chores to complex interactions requiring emotional comprehension. Furthermore, the study addresses the emotional connection between humans and robots, a pivotal aspect demonstrated by WALL-E's ability to evoke empathy. Ethical implications surrounding user data privacy, emotional manipulation, and the potential for over-reliance on such robots are explored.},
