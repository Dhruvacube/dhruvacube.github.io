This inspired me to create a game based on the song’s narrative. After making some modifications and shaping the plot, I implemented the concept into an interactive game using Scratch.</p> <p>I would like to extend my gratitude to the songwriter P4LE C4RR0TZ (who prefers to remain unnamed) for allowing me to use his original songs in the game, adding a distinct layer of creativity and atmosphere to the experience.</p> <p>Exclusively developed for the “Google Code to Learn 2018” initiative, “Cabinet Man” merges storytelling, music, and interactive gameplay within the Scratch platform. It offers players a chance to immerse themselves in a unique and engaging experience while showcasing the potential of creative coding in a fun and accessible way.</p> <div class="containerpdf"> <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/238148859/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> </body></html>
