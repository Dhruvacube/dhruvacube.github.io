<p style="text-align: justify;">
I’m an innovative and results-driven Robotics and Automation Engineer-in-training, passionate about merging hardware and software to build impactful, scalable solutions. My core strengths lie in Python development, Discord.py bot systems, full-stack web applications, and embedded systems.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I focus heavily on automating workflows and solving real-world problems with efficiency and creativity. Some of my hands-on work includes a <b>Mind-Controlled Bionic Arm with Sense of Touch</b>, and AI models for <b>early Osteoporosis detection</b>. I'm experienced with microcontroller platforms such as Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi, and well-versed in machine learning, IoT, and industrial automation.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In parallel, I contribute actively to STEM education and robotics competition ecosystems. Through India STEM Foundation and World Robot Olympiad (WRO) India, I’ve led programs that trained over 1,000 educators and developed 30-period STEM curriculums for schools nationwide. As the current lead for <b>WRO 2025 India</b>, I manage technical operations, event planning, and training infrastructure.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Most recently, I designed and developed <b>Adverse</b> — an AI-powered Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) system for digital identity verification and cyber surveillance. This innovation is now officially <b>published as a patent</b> by the Indian Patent Office.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As an active IEEE member and participant in standards working groups, I’m committed to open-source collaboration, R&D, and building solutions that bridge the gap between emerging technology and real-world deployment.
