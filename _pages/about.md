<p style="text-align: justify;">
I’m a Robotics and Automation Engineer dedicated to bridging hardware and software innovation to create intelligent, scalable solutions with real-world impact. My expertise spans Python development, AI-driven automation, embedded systems, and full-stack applications, all centered on building technologies that make systems smarter and lives easier.

I’m passionate about engineering systems that think and act. My work ranges from developing a Mind-Controlled Bionic Arm with a Sense of Touch to creating AI models for early Osteoporosis detection, blending neuroscience, data, and machine intelligence into human-centric design. I work extensively with Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi, with practical experience in machine learning, IoT, and industrial automation.

Beyond engineering, I actively contribute to India’s STEM education and robotics ecosystem. As part of the India STEM Foundation and World Robot Olympiad (WRO) India, I’ve helped train over 1,000 educators and co-developed nationwide STEM curricula. Currently, as the Technical Lead for WRO India 2025, I oversee event strategy, infrastructure, and training programs, nurturing the next generation of innovators.

Recently, I designed and built Adverse — an AI-powered Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) platform for digital identity verification and cyber surveillance. This innovation has been granted publication by the Indian Patent Office, marking a key milestone in my pursuit of secure and ethical AI applications.

As an active IEEE member and contributor to standards working groups, I believe technology should remain open, accessible, and impactful. My work under Creative नेट (Creative Net) embodies this principle — “Building Together, Sharing Freely” — combining research, creativity, and engineering discipline to advance automation for everyone.
