Myself a natural discord.py bot developer and a full stack developer using python. A Robotics Engineering undergrad 

student, my passion is with Electronics Automation and software projects related to the automation while using in-built 

AI. Writeups and researches related to my projects are open-sourced and available for all towards a positive 

contribution. Head over to my github for a detailed insight.
