I’m a **Robotics and Automation Engineer** passionate about uniting hardware and software to build intelligent, scalable technologies with real-world impact. My experience spans AI-driven automation, embedded systems, and full-stack development, with hands-on projects such as a <a href="https://thecreativenet.in/products/mcba/" target="_blank">Mind-Controlled Bionic Arm with Sense of Touch</a> and [AI models for early Osteoporosis detection](/projects/osteoarthirities/). I’ve worked extensively with **Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi, focusing on machine learning, IoT, and industrial automation**. 

I’m also the inventor of [Adverse](/adverse/), an AI-powered OSINT platform published as a patent by the Indian Patent Office, and an active IEEE member committed to open, ethical innovation through my organization, <a href="https://thecreativenet.in/" target="_blank">Creative नेट (Creative Net)</a> — guided by the principle “**Building Together, Sharing Freely.**”

My mission is to leverage technology to solve complex problems, enhance human capabilities, and drive positive change in society. Let’s connect and explore how we can innovate together!
