<p style="text-align: justify;">
I’m a <b>Robotics and Automation Engineer</b> passionate about uniting hardware and software to build intelligent, scalable technologies with real-world impact. My experience spans AI-driven automation, embedded systems, and full-stack development, with hands-on projects such as a <a href="https://thecreativenet.in/products/mcba/" target="_blank">Mind-Controlled Bionic Arm with Sense of Touch</a> and <a href="/projects/osteoarthirities/">AI models for early Osteoporosis detection</a>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I’m also the inventor of <a href="/adverse/">Adverse</a>, an AI-powered OSINT platform published as a patent by the Indian Patent Office, and an active IEEE member committed to open, ethical innovation through my organization, <a href="https://thecreativenet.in/" target="_blank">Creative नेट (Creative Net)</a> — guided by the principle “<b>Building Together, Sharing Freely.</b>”
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
My mission is to leverage technology to solve complex problems, enhance human capabilities, and drive positive change in society. Let’s connect and explore how we can innovate together!
