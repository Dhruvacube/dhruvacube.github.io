The **Micromouse** project is an autonomous robot designed to navigate and solve a maze in the shortest time possible. The robot uses a unique maze traversal algorithm, combining the **A\*** search algorithm with the **Flood Fill Algorithm**, enhanced by a **modified heuristic**. This hybrid approach optimizes the robot's decision-making and pathfinding abilities, enabling efficient navigation through complex maze environments.

The Micromouse is built using the **ESP21-DEVKIT V1 microcontroller**, programmed with **MicroPython**, which offers flexibility and ease of control. The design of the robot’s PCB (Printed Circuit Board) was carried out in **EASY EDA**, ensuring an optimized layout for the robot’s components.

This project was specifically developed for **Techfest 2023-2024**, showcasing innovation in autonomous robotics and algorithmic maze-solving. The combination of advanced algorithms, a compact microcontroller, and a custom PCB design makes this Micromouse an impressive demonstration of practical robotics and software development.

Now I am targetting All Japan Micromouse Contest.
