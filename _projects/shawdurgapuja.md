The "Shaw Durga Puja" project was conceived to address the challenges of sharing and preserving the traditional Durga Puja rituals, which our family has been performing since 2001. Initially documented through hardcopy photos, the need for a more accessible and modern solution arose with the advent of video calling technology. As group calling features were not yet available, there were occasions when we wished to share the puja with distant relatives and friends, but it proved difficult.

To solve this, I developed the idea of live streaming the Durga Puja, ensuring that every significant moment is recorded and preserved for eternity. This website was created with valuable feedback from my elders, combining tradition with technology. It allows us to stream the rituals live, enabling family members and friends, regardless of location, to participate in the celebrations in real time.

The website remains inactive for most of the year and is activated exclusively during the Durga Puja festivities. This ensures that the platform is dedicated to preserving the sanctity of the puja season while keeping the connection alive for our loved ones who cannot be physically present.

Through this platform, we aim to connect our distant relatives and friends with the cultural and spiritual significance of Durga Puja, ensuring the continuity of our cherished traditions while embracing the digital age.
