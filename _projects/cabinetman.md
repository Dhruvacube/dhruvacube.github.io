The "Cabinet Man" project began with no clear idea, but everything changed when a school friend introduced me to the song "Cabinet Man" by Lemon Demon. This inspired me to create a game based on the song's narrative. After making some modifications and shaping the plot, I implemented the concept into an interactive game using Scratch.

I would like to extend my gratitude to the songwriter P4LE C4RR0TZ (who prefers to remain unnamed) for allowing me to use his original songs in the game, adding a distinct layer of creativity and atmosphere to the experience.

Exclusively developed for the "Google Code to Learn 2018" initiative, "Cabinet Man" merges storytelling, music, and interactive gameplay within the Scratch platform. It offers players a chance to immerse themselves in a unique and engaging experience while showcasing the potential of creative coding in a fun and accessible way.
