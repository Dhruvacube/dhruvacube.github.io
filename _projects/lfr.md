title: Line Following Robot with PID
description: This Line Following Robot (LFR) automatically adjusts its PID values using the Ziegler-Nichols method for optimal performance. The project is being developed for Techfest at IIT Bombay (May 2023 - Present). Proteus is used for circuit simulation, and the PCB design is done with EASY EDA.

The **Line Following Robot (LFR)** project is focused on creating a robot that autonomously follows a line with precise control using a **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)** controller. This robot intelligently adjusts its PID parameters using the **Ziegler-Nichols method**, a well-known technique for tuning control systems, ensuring smooth and accurate movement along the line.

The project is ongoing, with development for **Techfest at IIT Bombay** (May 2023 - Present). The robot's circuit design and simulation are carried out using **Proteus**, while the **PCB design** is done using **EASY EDA**, which ensures an efficient and optimized layout. The combination of adaptive PID control and the robust design makes this LFR an innovative solution for autonomous navigation.
