During the COVID-19 period (2020-2021), graduating students across the globe were unable to experience their traditional school memories, including farewell events and other celebratory activities, due to restrictions and lockdowns. The absence of such milestones left many students feeling disconnected from their school life.

To bridge this gap, I conceptualized and developed the "LA22B" project, which provides an innovative solution to organize a virtual farewell and fun activities for graduating students. The project was designed to recreate the joy and excitement of a farewell, offering an engaging and memorable experience despite the physical distance.

Through this platform, students were able to participate in various fun-filled activities and celebrations, helping them form lasting memories of their graduation, even in such challenging times. The goal of "LA22B" was to bring joy and closure to their school journey, ensuring that these important moments were not lost to the pandemic.
