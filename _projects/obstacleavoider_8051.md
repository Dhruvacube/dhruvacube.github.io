The **8051 Obstacle Avoider** project involves creating a system that enables a robot to autonomously detect and avoid obstacles. The system is built around the **8051 microcontroller**, which is programmed using **Keil**, a popular development environment for 8051-based projects. The robot's movement and obstacle detection are simulated virtually in **Proteus**, providing an efficient and realistic testing environment before physical implementation. This project showcases the application of microcontroller programming for real-time decision-making and autonomous navigation.
